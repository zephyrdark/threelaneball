# threelaneball
Simple movement collision game to test my beginner skills  
Made in Python, using pygame and random modules

1. Press left or right arrow keys to move ball in that direction once
2. Collect balls as they fall
3. Each score increases the balls' falling speed
4. See how much you can score before your lives run out

Features:

- Instanced high score (does not stay after code is exited)
- Lives
- Difficulty ramping (Obstacles speed up)
- Exit menu
